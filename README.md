# Reido Vidaya Mahardika - Data Engineer / Data Scientist

👋 Hello and welcome!

I’m Reido Vidaya Mahardika, a Data Scientist and Data Analyst passionate about transforming raw data into impactful insights. With solid training from Hacktiv8’s Data Science program, I’ve developed strong skills in data analysis, visualization, machine learning, and data processing using Python, SQL, and various data science libraries.

I have completed several case study projects that demonstrate my ability to work with data end-to-end — from data cleaning to generating actionable insights that support decision-making. Currently, I’m focused on expanding my portfolio and building data-driven solutions for real-world challenges.

I believe that curiosity, persistence, and an analytical mindset are key to unlocking real value from data for both businesses and society.
